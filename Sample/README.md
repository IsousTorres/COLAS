# Sample implementation
This folder contains an example.php file that uses the integrationconfig.json file to define Triggers & Actions 
to send user to a demo queue.

## Running the example on Windows
 1. Run the runwebsite.bat file to start at PHP webser on port 8000.
 2. Open http://localhost:8000/example.php in a browser (use Incognito / private window so it's easy to simulate new user by closing / opening new browser)
